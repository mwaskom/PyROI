Dependencies
============

PyROI relies on quite a few dependencies both in the form of Python
packages and compiled binaries.  It will run properly in the NiPype
environment on the Mindhive cluster at MIT, which can be accessed
from a bash command line with the following code::

$ source /software/python/SetupNiPy26.sh

Currently, PyROI is undergoing internal testing at MIT and is not
really released for use elsewhere.
