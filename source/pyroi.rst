PyROI Home
==========

PyROI is a Python package for region of interest extraction and
analysis in functional neuroimaging.  It currently interfaces with
`SPM <http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`_ first-level functional
data, and it can extract data from a variety of atlases, including
those created by `Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_,
the `Talairach Daemon <http://www.talairach.org/>`_, or from regions
defined by the user.
