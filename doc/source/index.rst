`SPM <http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`_ first-level functional
data, and it can extract data from a variety of atlases, including
those created by `Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_,
the Harvard-Oxford Atlas from `FSL <http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl//>`_, 
or from regions created by the user.
